### 1.8: unicafe step3

Refactor your application so that displaying the statistics is extracted into its own Statistics component. The state of the application should remain in the App root component.

Remember that components should not be defined inside other components:

```
// a proper place to define a component
const Statistics = (props) => {
  // ...
}

const App = () => {
  const [good, setGood] = useState(0)
  const [neutral, setNeutral] = useState(0)
  const [bad, setBad] = useState(0)

  // do not define a component within another component
  const Statistics = (props) => {
    // ...
  }

  return (
    // ...
  )
}
```
